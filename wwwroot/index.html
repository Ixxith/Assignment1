    <p><b>What I hope to get out of this class </b><br /> The things I want to get out of this class include understanding enterprise development, learning a new language, and becoming familiar in using ASP.Net. I want to be able to understand how development works on a large scale so that if I start working in a large company, I can be confident while developing there. I also want to learn a strongly typed language, which we will be doing in this class by using C#. Finally, this class will help me become familiar with ASP.net and using the MVC development model, which will be important to learn as these tools are often used for development.</p>
